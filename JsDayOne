<!-- javascript -->

->javascript is one high level programming language.
->it is used to add functionalities to our web page.

->we can write js code in two ways.
  1.Internal Js
  2.External js

<!-- *  Internal Js -->
->internal js means writing the js code in same HTML file.

how to write:
 1.we have to take one script tage and this tag should be placed in side the body tag at the end.
  eg:  
  <body>
  <script>
   // js code
  </script>
  </body>
  

  <!-- 2.External js -->

  * Writing the js code into seperate file and  then link between the html and js file.

  eg:
  <script srv"path of the js file"></script>
